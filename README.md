# Kotlin excercises

This repository contains some easily-understandable code for helping other study.
It also contains a rather interesting OOP quote generator implementation.

Some example quotes:

`One dragon never drinks himself in its throne.
One small dog always defeats the small dog before the light.
The dragon only kills a glass of water when it barks.
One dragon always drinks the king in the jungle.
A dragon always drinks the king after the fight.
One little pig never kills the king in the jungle.
Many little pig always barks the small dog before the dark.`
